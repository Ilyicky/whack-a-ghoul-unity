Whack-a-Ghoul is a fast-paced, arcade-style 3D game where players use the mouse to defeat ghouls rising from graves. Players choose from three difficulty levels, each increasing the number and speed of ghouls. The game runs on a 60-second timer, during which players must rack up as many points as possible by clicking on different types of ghouls, each with unique score values. Ghouls appear randomly in one of 15 grave spots and disappear after a short time if not defeated. The game features particle effects, sound feedback, a high score system using PlayerPrefs, and a clean UI that tracks score and time. After the timer ends, players can restart or save their score if it ranks in the top five.
